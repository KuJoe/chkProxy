1.1 -	Fixed bug that caused duplicate lookups to Maxmind.
1.2 -	Fixed bug that caused client account to be registered even if order was blocked.
	Replaced redirect with error message on the shopping cart.
	Removed template files.
1.3 -	Fixed version number typo.
	Better formatting and comments for non-code savvy users.
	Updated instructions.
1.4 -	Added database table to conserve Maxmind queries and for reviewing scores.
	Created a WHMCS report for the last 50 proxy check scores.
	
//Requirements:
You need to purchase Proxy Detection queries from Maxmind (the free minFraud queries will NOT work). http://www.maxmind.com/en/proxy

//Installation:
1) Set $license_key in chkProxy.php:
2) Create mod_chkproxy table in WHMCS database (query below).
3) Upload the chkProxy.php file into your WHMCS's hooks directory (/includes/hooks/).
4) Upload the last_50_proxy_checks.php file into your WHMCS's reports directory (/modules/reports/).

//Optional:
A) Edit $max_score to fine tune detection (lower means will block more proxies but also have a higher change of blocking legit clients also). SEE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
B) Edit $error to fit your needs and match your template. To test your error message without access to a proxy/VPN, just set the $max_score to 0.00 to force the message to trigger (no orders will be processed until this is changed back).

//Query to create database table (run this command in phpMyAdmin, Adminer, SQLBuddy, command line, or your MySQL editor of choice):
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `mod_chkproxy` (
	  `chkid` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `ipaddr` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	  `proxyscore` varchar(4) NOT NULL,
	  `dt` TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	  PRIMARY KEY (`chkid`)
);


//Additional Information:
A $max_score of 1.7-1.8 is recommended. I've found that many large data centers return a score of 1.8 and every US residential ISP that I've tested has been a 0.00 so you can adjust accordingly. If you want to find the score of a specific IP address use the following URL in your browser:
https://minfraud.maxmind.com/app/ipauth_http?l=YOURLICENCEKEY&i=IPADDRESS

If your website is behind a reverse proxy (i.e. CloudFlare) this hook might not work. You will need to configure your webserver to display the correct IP address of visitors.
